# DJ Key Console App - With Rust!
This is a little program to help me learn rust and get comfortable with the language. The goal with the project is to be able to punch in any key either normally described or using the "Camelot Mix Wheel" and to return the key in the other form as well as addtional key related information.

For example:

> --camelot 6A

```
5A      < 6A      > 7A
          ^
D Minor < G Minor > C Minor
```

or for another example
> --key Db Major
```
2B       < 3B       > 4B
F# Major < Db Major > Ab Major
           ^
```


## Other Features to add
- Colored console output
- Full object testing
